                <p><b>One Piece</b> is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by <b>Eiichiro Oda.</b>
                    It has been serialized in <b>Shueisha's shōnen manga</b> magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July <b>1997</b>, with
                    its individual chapters compiled into 101 tankōbon volumes as of December 2021. The story follows
                    the adventures of <b>Monkey D. Luffy</b>, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after
                    unintentionally eating a <b>Devil Fruit.</b> With his pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores
                    the Grand Line in search of the world's ultimate treasure known as the <q>One Piece</q> in order to
                    become the next King of the Pirates.<br><br>

                    The manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival film produced by Production
                    I.G, and an anime series produced by <b>Toei Animation</b>, which began broadcasting in Japan in <b>1999.</b>
                    Additionally, Toei has developed <b>fourteen animated feature films</b>, one OVA and thirteen television
                    specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising and media, such as a
                    trading card game and numerous video games. The manga series was licensed for an <b>English language</b>
                    release in North America and the United Kingdom by <b>Viz Media</b> and in Australia by <b>Madman
                    Entertainment.</b> The anime series was licensed by <b>4Kids Entertainment</b> for an English-language release
                    in North America in 2004, before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by Funimation in
                    2007.<br><br>

                    One Piece has received praise for its <b>storytelling, art, characterization, and humor.</b> It has
                    received many awards and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the <b>best manga of
                    all time.</b> Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial
                    print run of any book in Japan. In 2015, One Piece set the Guinness World Record for "the most
                    copies published for the same comic book series by a single author". It was the <b>best-selling manga</b>
                    for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, and is the only manga that had an initial print of
                    volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than 10 years, as well as the only that had
                    achieved more than <b>1 million copies</b> sold in all of its 100 published tankōbon volumes.<br><br>

                    As of July 2021, One Piece had over <b>490 million copies</b> in circulation in 58 countries and regions
                    worldwide, making it the best-selling manga series in history, and the best-selling comic series
                    printed in book volume. It is also one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.</p>
