                <p><b>The Left Hand of Darkness</b> is a science fiction novel by U.S. writer <b>Ursula K. Le Guin.</b> Published in
                    1969, it became immensely popular, and established Le Guin's status as a major author of science
                    fiction. The novel is set in the <b>fictional Hainish universe</b> as part of the <b>Hainish Cycle</b>, a
                    series of novels and short stories by Le Guin, which she introduced in the 1964 short story "The
                    Dowry of Angyar". It was fourth in sequence of writing among the Hainish novels, preceded by City of
                    Illusions, and followed by <b>The Word for World Is Forest.</b><br><br>

                    The novel follows the story of Genly Ai, a human native of Terra, who is sent to the planet of
                    Gethen as an envoy of the Ekumen, a loose confederation of planets. Ai's mission is to persuade the
                    nations of Gethen to join the Ekumen, but he is stymied by a lack of understanding of their culture.
                    Individuals on Gethen are ambisexual, with no fixed sex; this has a strong influence on the culture
                    of the planet, and creates a <b>barrier of understanding</b> for Ai.<br><br>

                    The Left Hand of Darkness was among the first books in the genre now known as <b>feminist science
                    fiction</b> and is the most famous examination of androgyny in science fiction. A major theme of the
                    novel is the effect of <b>sex and gender</b> on culture and society, explored in particular through the
                    relationship between Ai and Estraven, a Gethenian politician who trusts and helps Ai. When the book
                    was first published, the gender theme touched off a feminist debate over the depiction of the
                    ambisexual Gethenians. The novel also explores the interaction between the unfolding loyalties of
                    its two main characters, the loneliness and rootlessness of Ai, and the contrast between the
                    religions of Gethen's two major nations.<br><br>

                    The Left Hand of Darkness has been reprinted more than 30 times, and received high praise from
                    reviewers. In 1970 it was voted <b>the Hugo and Nebula Awards</b> for Best Novel by fans and writers,
                    respectively, and was ranked as the third best novel, behind Frank Herbert's Dune and Arthur C.
                    Clarke's Childhood's End, in a 1975 poll in Locus magazine. In 1987, Locus ranked it second among
                    science fiction novels, after Dune, and literary critic Harold Bloom wrote, "Le Guin, more than
                    Tolkien, has raised fantasy into high literature, for our time".</p>
