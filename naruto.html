                <p><b>Naruto</b> (Japanese: NARUTOナルト) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by <b>Masashi Kishimoto.</b>
                    It tells the story of <b>Naruto Uzumaki</b>, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams
                    of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts – the first set in
                    Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by
                    Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop
                    Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).<br><br>

                    Naruto was serialized in <b>Shueisha's magazine</b>, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in
                    tankōbon (book) form in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an <b>anime</b> television series produced
                    by <b>Pierrot and Aniplex</b>, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English dub of
                    the series aired on <b>Cartoon Network</b> and <b>YTV</b> from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the
                    original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes. The English dub
                    was broadcast on <b>Disney XD</b> from 2009 to 2011, airing the first 98 episodes, and then switched over
                    to <b>Adult Swim's Toonami programming</b> block in January 2014, starting over from the first episode. The
                    English dub is still airing weekly on Adult Swim to this day. <b>Viz Media</b> began streaming the anime
                    series on their streaming service Neon Alley in December 2012 on 99 episodes, and ended on March
                    2016, after 338 episodes. Besides the anime series, Pierrot has developed eleven movies and twelve
                    original video animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related merchandise includes light novels, video
                    games, and trading cards developed by several companies.<br><br>

                    Viz Media licensed the manga and anime for North American production and serialized Naruto in their
                    digital Weekly <b>Shonen Jump magazine.</b> The anime series began airing in the United States and Canada
                    in 2005, and in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The films and most
                    OVAs from the series were also released by Viz, with the first film premiering in movie theaters.
                    The story of Naruto continues with Naruto's son, <b>Boruto Uzumaki</b>, in <b>Boruto: Naruto Next Generations</b>:
                    Boruto wishes to create his own ninja way instead of following his father's.<br><br>

                    Naruto is the <b>fourth best-selling manga</b> series in history having <b>250 million copies</b> in circulation
                    worldwide in 47 countries and regions, with 153 million copies in Japan alone and remaining 97
                    million copies elsewhere. It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their English
                    translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller list
                    several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga's
                    character development, strong storylines, and well-executed fight scenes, though some felt the fight
                    scenes slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, makes
                    use of cultural references from <b>Japanese mythology and Confucianism.</b></p>
